James Behnke - Module 4 Challenge

Got it all to work, though as you can tell in the code... 
I'm not too succinct with the code, but was grateful for the 
sample code toward the end to reveal how I could simplify. 

Due to the tedium that was this assignment, I elected not 
to go back and clean things up. Left some thougths where 
appropriate, eg:
- cell 14? "made a baby frame" - I now know how to improve this

I don't beleive there's much else noteworthy. 

1) I kept the same filepath as was downloaded
2) Used the pyCitySchools_starter entirely
3) And you'll find my analysis neatly pinned to the top of this workbook
